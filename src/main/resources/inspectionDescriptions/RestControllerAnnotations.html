    Detects JAX-RS controllers that can be converted to Spring MVC.
</p>
<p>
    This inspection detects <b>all</b> JAX-RS rest controllers as sources for migration to Spring MVC.
    In many cases the class cannot be completely converted automatically into a fully functional
    Spring MVC controller, but the inspection will suggest a quickfix to do the bulk of the changes,
    and leave the final bits and pieces for manual fixing.
</p>
<p>
    The quick fix will convert JAX-RS annotations to Spring MVC annotations, and add @RequestBody
    annotations where needed. It will also change the return type of annotated methods from
    JAX-RS Response to Spring MVC ResponseEntity, and in some cases rewrite the actual return statement
    to return a ResponseEntity instance.
